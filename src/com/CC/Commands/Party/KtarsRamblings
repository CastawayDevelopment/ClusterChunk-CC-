So in this file, i will talk about the commands.
First off we need to adjust the partycommands.java and the help.java.
Secondly we need to add the insides/code of the commands which i will do soon.
Thirdly the status command will be sort of like the following:
============[Party Stats]============
Players: -/4  ?, ?, ?, ?
Leader: ?
Queued: Yes<red/blue (versus ?)>/no
Pending Invites: ?, ?, ?
============[Party Stats]============
Fourthly need to add the versus and get all that working
Fifthly the invites.
To be edited..
